# Randon Project

I built this project with the picture in mind of it being a part of a big overall framework

### Some Features

  - Efficient dependency management 
  - Methods can be accessed via both SOAP and REST
  - Components based development
  - Remote EJB for disctributed systems
  - No Stubbed Data (Insert then Retrieve)
  - Entities are set to auto-drop and create on wildfly's embedded H2 database 

### Whats not there

- Unit Tests (need to put them in), will be using TestNG
